This documents some of the game mechanics I want to have.

- Your role: You take on the role of a governor of a small town far away from
  civilization. The people with you are hardy settlers, looking to stake a
  claim to their own land. Your options are myriad. Will you lead your people
  to greatness? Or will you watch as each of your people are slaughtered and
  enslaved by greedy orcs and goblins?

- Individuals: Each individual in your city has their own skills and profession
  and attitudes. Family relationships are important. Part of your job is to
figure out what is going on and how you can help (or hurt) individuals lives.

- Population control. Each turn, some babies are born. They tend to be born
  too quickly. Don't worry, there are diseases and plagues and random events
to keep your population in check.

- Delegation. Part of the game is delegating to capable individuals in your
  government. You'll find them from your people. Be sure to groom people,
since when your current leaders die, they need to be replaced.

- Part of a larger world. Surrounding your city are other things in this
  world. For example:
	- Your nation may call upon you to raise an army. Will they ever come
	  back? Who knows what horrors await them.


	- There are populations of orcs, goblins, etc... around you, and they
	  interact with your city, usually in a negative way. Send out
patrols, raise the guards, protect your city!

	- Adventurers, heroes, and mercenaries will drift through town from
	  time to time.  Will you let them in? Or will you bribe them to go
	  away?

- Quests: Each turn is about a month's time. Each month, you'll get a number
  of issues that arise. Each is a quest. Handling each in different ways will
  have certain results. The kinds of issues may be:

  - Bandits raiding.
  - Monster tribe is demanding tribute.
  - Tax time!
  - Neighborly disputes.
  - Find the criminal.
  - Someone in town asks for some help.
  - A wizard has set up shop and is causing problems for your people.
  - A witch! Burn her? Save her?
  - A priest comes to your town and demands that the people pay their tithes
    and offerings, or God will curse the land. Or maybe he asks that you build
    him a small church, or maybe a big one, or maybe a huge castle!

- Buildings: As you progress, you build buildings that give you and the people
  certain bonuses.

  - Homes: Homes come in a variety of shapes and sizes. All the people need to
    ask you before they build in the city.

  - Shops: Shops are where commerce occurs between the local citizen and the
    merchants. They will start by asking you to set aside space for a
    marketplace. When that fills up, they will ask to purchase some land for a
    shop.

  - Inns. Inns provide relief for your people, but at a cost! Their money will
    be wasted on booze and gambling, unless you can keep order!

  - Churches. Churches engender favor with God, who should help you in your
    various problems. Churches also act as libraries and hospitals to your
    people. But beware! If the churchmen get too powerful, they may start
    calling the shots!

  - Merchant guild halls. These guild halls are places where merchants can
    buy, sell, and trade between cities. They are absolutely necessary if you
    want to start moving serious goods.

  - Workshops: There are many kinds of workshops, and each of them have their
    own uses. generally, they make goods.

  - Storehouses: Storehouses store the government's goods.

  - Banks: Banks allow people to have currency. Beware of bankers!

  - Walls, castles, towers, forts: These are used for military purposes.

  - farms: Farms can be owned by you or owned by your people. Either way, they
    need to be worked to generate crops. You can also set up renters who simply
    have to pay in kind each year.

  - Schools, universities: In schools and universities, your people can get
    advanced educations. They also house professors and teachers.

  - Public works: Roads, dykes, dams, ports, etc...: These increase the
    available land, speed travel, and provide all kinds of bonuses


Distant Future
--------------

I'd like to build a text-based world similar to the level of detail that Dwarf
Fortress has. You can choose to be anyone, do anything. Since people have
emotions and their own intentions, you can play off of them or each other. For
instance, let's say you decide to be a bandit, and so you setup a camp outside
of town. You rob the passersby, and they complain to the government, who
dispatches a patrol to get rid of you. The commander of that unit figures out
who you are and what you are up to. If you're small, he'll just beat you up,
take you in, and take all of your stuff, giving some of it to the government
to return to the people. If you're strong, he'll warn you from what you are
doing. If you're really strong, he'll treat you like an equal, and you can
setup a quid-pro-quo. If you're really, really strong, he may even defect and
call you the local lord!
