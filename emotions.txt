Emotions work like traits, except they are constantly wavering based on the
life eperiene of the individuals.

- happy
- healthy (really a physical state)
- sane
- focus

Some conditions may limit the cap of these emotions. For instance, if a person
was maimed, they will never reach full heath again.
