Improving Skills:

People improve skills through practice. Not using a skill leads to it
deteriorating. In general, it is a sort of logarithmic decline, meaning, you
forget 1/2 of what you knew after 1 year, 1/4 more after the 2nd year, 1/8 the
third. In the end, you will remember a great deal if you knew a great deal
after a long time with no practice.

People who are intelligent learn skills more quickly.

Skills can be taught. The teaching skill is used to do so in a classroom type
setting. Although teaching is very fast, it can only get a student to a basic
level. Mentoring is another way to enhance skill learning. Sacrificing some of
hte effectiveness of the mentor, the mentee(s) will gain skills even more
quickly, and can reach mastery.

Skill Ratings:

Skill levels are between 0 (completely unaware of the skill) and 10 (perfect
mastery). Each level in between represents a complete paradigm shift. People
who are level 3 in a skill seem like experts to people who are level 2. If you
were to say that a level 3 person is 10x as good as a level 2, then a level 10
person is 10^9 times better than a level 1.

Reaching level 10 in a lifetime is impossible. A student who starts from
nothing, no training or mentoring, at best, can reach a level 2 or 3 before
they die, even if they practice the skill every day. However, their level 2 or
3, combined with teaching and mentoring, can get the next generation to a
level 2 or 3 before they pass. Their improvements will get their skill level
up to a 3 or 4. Using this pattern, it is possible to get to level 10 in 5
generations, but only provided there is an unbroken chain of effective
mentoring and teaching.
