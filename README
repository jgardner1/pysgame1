PYSGAME1
========

A pyside game, hammurabi style.

INSPIRATION
===========

I like Civ 5, Banished, those sorts of games. But I like the idea of building
and problem solving more than overcoming specific bugs.


INSTALLING
==========

You'll need pyside and python.

One of these days, I'll make it a proper exe with some kind of tool.

RUNNING
=======

Just run pysgame1.py.

EDITING
=======

If you want to edit the MainWindow.ui file, you'll need to rebuild it with
pyside-uic. The output for it is Ui_MainWindow.ui.
