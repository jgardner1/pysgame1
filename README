PYSGAME1
========

A pyside game, hammurabi style.

INSPIRATION
===========

I like Civ 5, Banished, those sorts of games. But I like the idea of building
and problem solving more than overcoming specific bugs.


INSTALLING
==========

You'll need pyside and python.

One of these days, I'll make it a proper exe with some kind of tool.

RUNNING
=======

Just run pysgame1.py.

EDITING
=======

If you want to edit the MainWindow.ui file, you'll need to rebuild it with
pyside-uic. The output for it is Ui_MainWindow.ui.

PACKAGING
=========

See http://qt-project.org/wiki/Packaging_PySide_applications_on_Windows

I've written a simple spec file that includes the data files. I've also got the
resource_path function that will load from the bundled files.

To build:

 python wherever-you-installed\PyInstaller-2.1\pyinstaller.py --onefile .\pysgame1.spec

To run the .exe: Just navigate to the dist/ folder and run pysgame1.exe
