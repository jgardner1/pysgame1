FAIRS

Merchants travel a fair circuit, protected by the owner of the circuit who
generally holds the host responsible. These are how most economic activity is
handled.

Local fairs occur in connection with the bigger fair. Groups of minor
merchants sweep through the smaller villages and arrive at the larger towns
just as the fair arrives.

The fairs follow an annual circuit.
