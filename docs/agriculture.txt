A person needs about 25 bushels of mixed produce to survive a year. 3/4 come
from crops grown into the field. (1/4 from meat, fish, garden fruit and
vegetables and foraged foods.) Thus, each person needs about 2.5 acres of
wheat, barley and legumes. In a poor year, 4-5 acres are needed per person.


Three Field system:
Each family holds a number of strips of land (selions). A field will contain
mabt selions. The Lord will have some selions mixed in with the others.

There are three fields. They rotate each year. One has a winter crop, sown in
autumn, harvested in summer), one has spring crops (sown after last frost for
harvest in autumn) and the other left bare, maybe plowed, or used for grazing.

The fields are broken up into furlongs unevenly. A single crop is grown in
each furlong. Each furlong has several selions.  Selions are about 1/2 acre.
They are long to make plowing easy.

A peasant is given selions in each of the three fields, in each of the
furlongs, to ensure that they have a variety of food. A half-virgater (typical
peasant) has 20-25 selions. A virgater (wealthy peasant) has 45-50 or more.

Steward keeps a record of who owns what, combined with memory and tradition.
