Manors were pieces of land about 1200-1800 acres. That's an area about 1.5
miles on each side. The land was called a "demesnes".

Nobles owned one or more manors. Great nobles held many. They derived all
their food and sustenance and money from them.

They built a manor house apart from the village. If the Lord lived on the
land, he would occupy it and manage the affairs. If not, then he appointed a
Bailiff in his stead.

Yeomen owned about 30-120 acres and owed the lord his hand and his bow.
Wealthy yeoman may be trained and armed in the sword, dagger and longbow.
Yeomen were often employed as guards.

Peasants were brought in. They were given rights to about 20-40 acres of land,
spread across the manor. In exchange, they would give food, money, or work 3
days a week on the lord's land. They had some rights to firewood, hay,
grazing and such on the waste --- the areas not cultivated.

Hunting rights were important. Sections of the manor were designated as
hunting grounds. Anyone caught hunting without the Lord's permission were
dealt with harshly. The Lord may appoint a Parks to manage the hunting
grounds and find and punish offenders.

Cottagers had a house in the village along with the peasants. They worked as a
laborer, and owned little or no land.

Servants worked in the lord's manor house and may have their own house in the
village.
 
This system was put into place after the Normans conquered England in 1066.
He gave all the manors to the French who were with him. 2 traitorous
englishmen were also given manors. There were about 9,000 manors at the time.

The Lord owed the people living on his land his protection.
